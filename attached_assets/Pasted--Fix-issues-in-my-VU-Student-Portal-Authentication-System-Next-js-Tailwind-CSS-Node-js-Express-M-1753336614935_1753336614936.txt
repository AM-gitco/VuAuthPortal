Fix issues in my VU Student Portal Authentication System (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js/Express, MongoDB):

✅ CURRENT STATUS:
Split-screen UI with login, signup, OTP verification, and forgot password forms.

OTP is sent via email during signup for verification.

Glassmorphism design with beautiful layout and branding.

Frontend is mostly working and styled correctly.

❌ ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Signup Flow / OTP Bug:
OTP page says "Back to Reset Password" — ❌ this should be "Back to Signup".

Currently, user data is saved to the database before OTP is verified — ❌

✅ Fix: Only save the user in MongoDB after OTP is verified successfully.

Store isVerified: true only when OTP is correct.

2. Login Flow Bug:
After a user logs in, it wrongly redirects again to the OTP page — ❌

✅ Fix: If isVerified === true, then login should directly redirect to the dashboard or home page, not OTP.

3. Forgot Password Full Flow:
Fix and implement:

Enter email → Send OTP → Verify OTP → Show form with:

New Password ✅

Confirm Password ✅

Then redirect to Login after successful password update.

✅ Ensure new password updates securely in database.

4. Admin User Setup:
✅ Add a default admin account manually into database:

Email: abdulmannan32519@gmail.com

Password: Mannamkhan@786 (hashed)

Role: "admin"

✅ Admin login must bypass OTP flow.

✅ All other users must:

Use VU email only (@vu.edu.pk)

Be marked with role "student" and follow full signup+OTP verification process.

5. Database Requirements:
Hash passwords using bcrypt ✅

Save the following fields:

email, name, username, password, isVerified, role, etc.

Add passwordResetToken (if needed) for forgot password.

Use token expiry for OTP (e.g. 10 minutes)

🛡️ Security & UX Fixes:
Don't store passwords in plain text ✅

Use clear alert/toast messages on:

OTP sent

OTP verified

Account created

Login success/failure

Password reset

✅ Final Testing Scenarios:

Admin login using provided credentials works directly.

New user signs up → gets OTP → verifies → logs in.

Verified user logs in without OTP.

Forgot password works as intended.
